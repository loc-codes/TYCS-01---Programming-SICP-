Subject 1 - Programming.
Most undergraduate CS programs start with an “introduction” to computer programming. 
The best versions of these courses cater not just to novices, but also to those who missed beneficial concepts and programming models while first learning to code.
Our standard recommendation for this content is the classic Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
